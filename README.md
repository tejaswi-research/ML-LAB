# ML Lab

This repository contains research prototypes and visual tools for understanding how machine learning models learn, evolve, and make decisions.

The goal is to bridge the gap between **conceptual understanding and code**, with a focus on learning dynamics, interpretability, and visual intuition.

This lab is under active development and will continuously grow with new experiments.

## Experiments
- Linear Regression (gradient descent visualisation)
- K-Means Clustering (centroid movement visualisation)
- Decision Tree (split formation visualisation)
